            <h5 class="card-title">Fibonacci Ratios in Trading</h5>
            <p class="card-text p-3">
              The golden ratio is frequently used by traders and technical analysts, who use it to forecast market-driven price movements. This is because the Fibonacci numbers and the golden ratio have a strong psychological importance in herd behavior. Traders are more likely to take profits or cover losses at certain price points, which happen to be marked by the golden ratio.</p>
              <p class="card-text p-3">When used in technical analysis, the golden ratio is typically translated into three percentages: 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8%. However, more multiples can be used when needed, such as 23.6%, 161.8%, 423%, and so on. Meanwhile, there are four ways that the Fibonacci sequence can be applied to charts: retracements, arcs, fans, and time zones. However, not all might be available, depending on the charting application being used.</p>

          <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">Loss Aversion Bias</h5>
            <p class="card-text p-3">Loss aversion bias is one of the biggest factors that affect traders and investors in day-to-day or long-term participation in the stock market. It is the mindset that a loss on an investment or trade of a sample dollar amount will affect a market participant on a deeper emotional or psychological level than a gain of the same amount.</p>

              <p class="card-text p-3">For example, if I took a trade today and lost $100 or $1000 on it, it would affect me significantly more than if I had gained $100 or $1000. The pain of losing the money would be psychologically twice as impactful as the pleasure of gaining the money.</p>
              
              <p class="card-text p-3">Almost all traders/investors are prone to this, and as a result, they tend to do as much as they can to avoid losses over achieving the same amount in gains. This leads to irrational thoughts and allows emotions to affect their positions, which can lead to selling early or exiting at a small loss to prevent a potential bigger one, which may never occur. Remembering to manage this bias separates good traders from bad traders</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Managing Risk</h5>
            <p class="card-text p-3">Managing your risk in trading is one of the most important parts of trading. By having solid stoplosses, you prevent yourself from incurring further losses. When trading, just ask yourself what would invalidate your trade. That level should be your stop and you should not exit at a loss unless that level is hit.</p>
            <p class="card-text p-3">Many times in trading, newer traders will not respect their stoplosses which leads to their account balances imploding. Traders must understand that a key stoploss is part of any good trading plan/strategy.</p>
