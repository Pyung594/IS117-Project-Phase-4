            <h5 class="card-title">Fibonacci Ratios in Trading</h5>
            <p class="card-text p-3">
              The golden ratio is frequently used by traders and technical analysts, who use it to forecast market-driven price movements. This is because the Fibonacci numbers and the golden ratio have a strong psychological importance in herd behavior. Traders are more likely to take profits or cover losses at certain price points, which happen to be marked by the golden ratio.</p>
              <p class="card-text p-3">When used in technical analysis, the golden ratio is typically translated into three percentages: 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8%. However, more multiples can be used when needed, such as 23.6%, 161.8%, 423%, and so on. Meanwhile, there are four ways that the Fibonacci sequence can be applied to charts: retracements, arcs, fans, and time zones. However, not all might be available, depending on the charting application being used.</p>

          <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">Loss Aversion Bias</h5>
            <p class="card-text p-3">Loss aversion bias is one of the biggest factors that affect traders and investors in day-to-day or long-term participation in the stock market. It is the mindset that a loss on an investment or trade of a sample dollar amount will affect a market participant on a deeper emotional or psychological level than a gain of the same amount.</p>

              <p class="card-text p-3">For example, if I took a trade today and lost $100 or $1000 on it, it would affect me significantly more than if I had gained $100 or $1000. The pain of losing the money would be psychologically twice as impactful as the pleasure of gaining the money.</p>
              
              <p class="card-text p-3">Almost all traders/investors are prone to this, and as a result, they tend to do as much as they can to avoid losses over achieving the same amount in gains. This leads to irrational thoughts and allows emotions to affect their positions, which can lead to selling early or exiting at a small loss to prevent a potential bigger one, which may never occur. Remembering to manage this bias separates good traders from bad traders</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Managing Risk</h5>
            <p class="card-text p-3">Managing your risk in trading is one of the most important parts of trading. By having solid stoplosses, you prevent yourself from incurring further losses. When trading, just ask yourself what would invalidate your trade. That level should be your stop and you should not exit at a loss unless that level is hit.</p>
            <p class="card-text p-3">Many times in trading, newer traders will not respect their stoplosses which leads to their account balances imploding. Traders must understand that a key stoploss is part of any good trading plan/strategy.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Fear and Greed in Markets</h5>
            <p class="card-text p-3">
                A fearful market is a market where moves up are quickly sold to secure profit, reduce position sizes, and selloffs occur a lot. When the market is fearful, investors tend to buy into value stocks.</p>
              <p class="card-text p-3">A value stock is a stock that tends to remain steady through all kinds of market conditions, even recessions, and takes a lot of time to gain in share price because it trades lower than its financial performance and fundamentals suggest it's worth. People buy into value stocks to secure their portfolios but most of all to get them when they are undervalued and cheap. 
                Examples of these stocks include: Walmart, Target, Berkshire Hathaway, Procter & Gamble, and Macy's.</p>
                <p class="card-text p-3">
                    A greedy market is a market where moves up tend to rally for days on end, position sizes are large, and market rallies tend to happen a lot. When the market is greedy, investors tend to buy into growth stocks.</p>
                  <p class="card-text p-3">A growth stock is a stock that moves rapidly and is very volatile, which investors buy into to profit from quick price movements upwards. These stocks tend to grow in price at a faster pace than the general market, have a competitive advantage over other stocks in the same sector/industry, and exhibit strong revenue/sales numbers. People buy these stocks to grow their portfolio balances aggressively and profit from strong markets.
                    Examples of these stocks include: Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Netflix, Google, and Tesla.

            <h5 class="card-title">Market Structure</h5>
            <p class="card-text p-3">Market structure is one of the most key parts of trading. Understanding market structure protects you from trading against the trend and helps influence entries and exits for trades. 

                Market structure is viewed through price action making new highs and lows. 
                </p>

              <p class="card-text p-3">There are 3 types of market structure:</p>
                <p class="card-text p-3">Uptrend - Higher highs and higher lows</p>
                <p class="card-text p-3">Downtrend - Lower highs and lower lows</p>
                <p class="card-text p-3">Range - Price trapped and bouncing between highs and lows</p>
              
              <p class="card-text p-3">
                Taking into account the current market structure will help traders better plan their trades and trade with the momentum of the market backing their trades. </p>

          <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">Anchor Bias</h5>
            <p class="card-text p-3">The anchor bias is a way of thinking which involves around staying in the same mindset of trading in an ever-changing market. The market is always changing and market conditions will not stay the same forever. Good traders are able to adapt to the market and make small changes to their strategy to fit changing market conditions. </p>
            <p class="card-text p-3">An example is this: A trader bought stock "XYZ" for $100 a few months ago in a market rally and the price of the stock pushed upwards to $110, where they sold it. A couple months later, stock "XYZ" returns to $100 as part of a rapid selloff as the market declines, and the trader buys it again, thinking the same thing will happen. The price of stock "XYZ" sells off to $90 and the trader takes a loss. </p>
            <p class="card-text p-3">One of the reasons that traders lose is that they stay focused on one aspect of the market and they fail to see that market is complex, and changing every single day. Traders may have to change certain aspects of the way they think each day or each week to reflect how the market changes. </p>
